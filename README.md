# Beer
Tools to generate a portable database of brewery information.

# What does this do?
These scripts will pull data from brewersassociation.org for every brewery in
a given state, and format it into a CSV that is suitable for general use.

# Why does this exist?
I was going on a road trip and wanted to visit some breweries. I located a
source of data, and whipped up this code to scrape it and get it into a format
I could import into Google Maps. Also, because beer.

# Usage
./beer.sh "New York"

# Data
The script will create a file `./archive/New York/YYYYMMDD.csv` with current
data from the brewery search function on brewersassociation.org. If any
previous CSV files for the given state exist, you'll also get a diff from
the most recent version.

The `./db` subdirectory contains manually edited tweaks to the CSV files
generated by the script. These are updated with fixed website URLs, phone
numbers, etc. The files in this directory, when available, should be
preferred over the raw files in `./archive`.
